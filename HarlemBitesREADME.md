## Process

### NOTE
- this setup contains a rakefile with helpful process reminders

### Setup
1. Create Gemfile + run `bundle`
2. Create migrations: run `rake db:create_migration` and add the syntax you need (e.g. `NAME=create_users`)
3. Migrate: run `rake db:migrate`
* **REMEMBER** never ever ever change anything in schema.
4. Go to `.bin/run.rb` and change the name of the app on line 3 AND/OR go to `Rakefile` and change the name of the app on line 15
5. Go to `./app/models` and change the names of the files (e.g. `User.rb` <- singular) and the class names inside
6. Set up association macros in classes (`belongs_to` / `has_many` / `has_many, through:`)
7. Create seed file in `db/seed.rb` + then run `rake db:seed`
* remember: seeding does not give you any output so no news on your console == good news
8. Check if you've seeded correctly: run `rake c` and check what's the last instance of any of your class 
9. Go to `./app/yourAppName.rb` and change that file's name and whatever is inside (the class name should correspond to what you wrote in `.bin/run.rb` on line 3)

### Coding
1. Create a dummy version of your logic -> hardcode it and don't yet make your code save anything to the database, just make sure that the logic works
2. Test often by running the file or by `binding.pry`
3. What I fould useful is drowing out every step I want to guide users through before coding - my whiteboard looked like this:
![](Sunday.jpg)
4. Then I coded the dummy version (without saving to the database, just to see if all "if"s are working and all that jazz)
5. Then I added the database manipulations.
6. Then I beautified the code and the app to make it visually pleasing
